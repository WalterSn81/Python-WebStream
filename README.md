My wife wanted a radio in the kitchen. I had a Raspi and LCD touch display lying around. No sooner said than done. First, I tried LibreELEC, but unfortunately, it's not that easy to switch between the built-in and a USB WiFi. Raspi OS + Kodi, well, the touchscreen didn't work in full-screen mode. It worked in normal mode, but the back function didn't. I didn't want to deal with the issue, so I wrote a Python script + QT. The script streams the online radio stations she wanted.

It's not professional code, and I don't care what you think :-)
